# Question 1:
    - Line 9 prints: values added: 20.
# Question 2:
    - Line 13 prints: final result: 20

# Question 3:
    - Line 9 prints: values added: 20.
# Question 4:
    - Line 13 returns an ERROR!
> Let has a block scope. Because of this, since result was initilaized within the if statement, result can only be used/printed within that if statement. Otherwise, we get an error, such as this case.

# Question 5:
    - Line 9 returns an ERROR!
> The reason it returns an error is because we initialized the const result to 0 and then on Line 7 we try to reassign result. That was the error, we can not reassign constants.
# Question 6:
    - Line 13 returns an ERROR!
> Const,similarly to Let, has a block scope. Because of this, since result was initilaized within the if statement, result can only be used/printed within that if statement. Otherwise, we get an error, such as this case.
